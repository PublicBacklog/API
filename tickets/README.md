### **What is a ticket?**
A ticket is the basic backbone of PublicBacklog. This is ultimately what you and your users will be creating and using to track feedback.

There are two different viewing modes for tickets. The User view and the Admin view.

#### **Admin View**
The admin view of a ticket is where your administrators will modify details about the ticket.

#### **User View**
The user view is the primary view a user will use to interact with tickets in your backlog.

### **Integrations**
Tickets connect with the outside world through their [integrations](/)
