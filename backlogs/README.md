### Backlogs

A Backlog in PublicBacklog is a place where you can gather specified feedback. Backlogs can be used to represent any number of Organizational products or services. If you want to be as granular as possible you can even break down different sections of a single product into multiple backlogs.

An Organization is the ultimate owner of a Backlog. The number of Backlogs an Organization can has is determined by it's subscription level. You can find more information on our [Home Page]() regarding how many Backlogs you may have with each subscription.

### General Information

On the Backlog settings page you'll find a General Information section. This section can be used to change the name of the Backlog. It can also be used to change the description. This description will appear under the main `_feedback` portion of your Backlog when users first visit it.

### Privacy

Backlogs come with their own individual privacy settings. By default a Backlog is created with the privacy set to **Public**. This can be changed right after Backlog creation on the settings page that you are immediately redirected to upon Backlog creation.

### Create Backlog

Adding a Backlog is the first step in collecting user feedback

To add a new Backlog go to your [Organization Dashboard]() and click on the **Create New Backlog** button

### Deactive Backlog

If you find that a Backlog is no longer needed by your Organization you are able to deactivate any Backlogs you own.

To do this navigate to the Backlog settings for the Backlog that you wish to deactivate. At the bottom of the page you will find the red Deactivate button.
