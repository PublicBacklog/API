### Backlogs

A Backlog in PublicBacklog is a place where you can gather specified feedback. Backlogs can be used to represent any number of Organizational products or services. If you want to be as granular as possible you can even break down different sections of one product into multiple backlogs.

An Organization is the ultimate owner of a Backlog. The number of Backlogs an Organization can has is determined by it's subscription level. You can find more information on our [Home Page]() regarding how many Backlogs you may have with each subscription.

### Privacy
Backlogs come with their own individual privacy settings. By default a Backlog is created with the privacy set to **Public**. This can be changed right after Backlog creation on the settings page that you are immediately redirected to upon Backlog creation.
