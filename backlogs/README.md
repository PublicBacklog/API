### Backlogs

A Backlog in PublicBacklog is where you collect targeted feedback. Use Backlogs to represent different products, services, or even specific sections of a single product for more granular control.


[Organizations]() own Backlogs. 

The **Free** tier allows 1 Backlog, **Starter** allows 3, and both **Business** and **Enterprise** tiers allow unlimited Backlogs.

You can find more information about tier differences on the [Home Page](https://www.publicbacklog.com/)

### General Information

In Backlog settings, the General Information section lets you change the Backlog name and description. The description appears under the main `_feedback` section when users visit the `_feedback` page for this Backlog.


### Privacy

Each Backlog has its own privacy settings. By default, a Backlog is set to **Public**. You can change this immediately after creation on the settings page you’re redirected to.


### Create Backlog

Adding a Backlog is the first step in collecting user feedback.

To create one, go to your [Organization Dashboard]() and click **Create New Backlog**.

### Deactive Backlog

If a Backlog is no longer needed, you can deactivate it.

Go to the Backlog settings for the target Backlog. At the bottom of the page, click the red **Deactivate** button.

This immediately blocks user interaction with the Backlog’s feedback and starts a 30-day retention period. After 30 days, all data from the Backlog is permanently deleted.

        Since ticket IDs are shared across the Organization, they are <strong>not</strong> renumbered when a Backlog's tickets are removed. This preserves the integrity of bookmarked links.
