### Github Integration

The PublicBacklog integration with Github is fairly straightforward! The Github integration is available at the Organizational level. So to get started navigate to the Organization settings for the Organization that you wish to install Github for. Then navigate to the Gitub section located under the [Backlog Integrations]().

Click the installation link and select the organization that owns the repo and then authorize the [PublicBacklog App]() to that Organization.

Thats it! Github is now installed to your Organization and you are ready to go.

### Exporting to Github

Exporting is the process that pushes our tickets to Github.

#### Single Ticket Export

To get started with a single ticket export navigate to the ticket that you want to export via the Tickets menu in the Backlog. Then in the tabs you'll see **Export.** If you've correctly installed Github to the Organization you will see an Export to Github button in this Export tab. Clicking that bring up a modal to select which repo you want to create the issue under. 

Once that's confirmed the issue will be created and opened up in a new window. 

#### Multi Ticket Export
