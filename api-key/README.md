        Ensure safe handling of your API key. This key grants with it access to all of our endpoints for interacting with PublicBacklog on behalf of your organization. It is recommended that you store your API key securely in environment variables and as part of your deployment procedure. Avoid making PublicBacklog requests from any client side code.

The generation of API keys is a straightforward procedure. The only thing to note is once we show it to you upon generator once you exit the page you will be unable to view the key again. So make sure to note it down immediately.

### Regenerating your API key

If you need to change your API key for whatever reason the process is almost identical, navigate to the API Configuration in your Organization Settings and click Generate New Api Key.

**This change will immediately invalidate the previously active API key.**
