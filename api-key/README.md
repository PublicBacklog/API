### Generating API Key

        Handle your API key securely. It grants full access to your organizationâ€™s PublicBacklog endpoints. Store it in environment variables and manage it through your deployment process. Never expose it in client-side code.
   </p> 
</div>

API key generation is simple. The key is shown only once; it won't be visible after you leave the page. Record it immediately.

### Regenerating your API key

To change your API key, go to API Configuration in Organization Settings and click Generate New API Key. The process is the same as initial creation.

**This action immediately invalidates the previous API key.**
