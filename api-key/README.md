### Generating API Key

The generation of API keys is a straightforward procedure. The only thing to note is once we show it to you upon generator once you exit the page you will be unable to view the key again. So make sure to note it down immediately.

### Regenerating your API key

If you need to change your API key for whatever reason the process is almost identical, navigate to the API Configuration in your Organization Settings and click Generate New Api Key.

**This change will immediately invalidate the previously active API key.**
