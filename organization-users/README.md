## PublicBacklog Organization Users

Organization Users are one of the most important parts of PublicBacklog. They're your users! The same users who will ultimately be providing the feedback to make your product or service better.

### Adding Organization Users

#### Public Backlogs

By default users are able to join any public backlog so long as it has user space left.

#### Private Backlogs

<div class="pb-warning">
    <i class="material-icons" style="font-size: 24px;">warning</i>
    <p>
        Backlogs are by default <strong style="color: #92400e">public</strong>, you can change this in the Organization Settings
   </p> 
</div>

If your backlog is set to private you have two options for allowing users to submit feedback depending on your PublicBacklog integration method.

#### With the &nbsp; [Simple Setup]()

The simple setup gives you more limited options when allowing user feedback. In your [Organization User Management]() section of your backlog you'll find two buttons. Upload and Download.

Start by clicking the Download button.
