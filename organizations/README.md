### What is an Organization?

An Organization represents you—it can be a single user or a group within a company. Each Organization has one owner and can have multiple admins.

You can belong to multiple Organizations as an owner or member. Users can own up to 2 free-tier Organizations and unlimited paid ones. There’s no limit to how many Organizations you can join.

Organizations own [Backlogs](). 

The **Free** tier allows 1 Backlog, **Starter** allows 3, and both **Business** and **Enterprise** tiers allow unlimited Backlogs.

You can find more information about tier differences on the [Home Page](https://www.publicbacklog.com/)

### Organization Name

Your Organization name is a unique identifier used in PublicBacklog URLs to determine which Organization and Backlog are being accessed.

You can change it later, but any existing setup—via [Simple Setup](/quick-start-easy/) or API integration—must be updated to reflect the new name for integrations to remain functional.

### Owner vs Admins

Admins can manage users, settings, and all Backlog operations within an Organization.

However, they cannot change the Organization name, transfer ownership, or delete the Organization. These actions are restricted to the owner and located in the [Danger Zone]() of [Organization Settings]().


### Create Organization

Creating an Organization is the first step in collecting user feedback. Go to the **Create or Join Organization** page and click **Create Organization**. Enter a unique Organization name. After creation, you’ll be redirected to [Organization Settings]().

There, you can generate an API key or configure third-party integrations. Once done, continue to [Create a Backlog]().



### Join an Existing Organization

Joining an existing Organization is simple. On the **Create or Join Organization** page, click **Join Organization** and enter the Organization name.

You’ll join as a regular user. For admin access, an existing admin must either use the [Add Admin]() function or update your role from the Organization Users list.

Once joined, you can interact with all Backlogs owned by the Organization.


### Delete Organization

Only the Organization owner can delete an Organization. This restriction prevents unauthorized or accidental deletions.

Deleted Organizations cannot be restored by users. Data is retained for 30 days, after which it is permanently removed. To request reinstatement during this window, contact [support@publicbacklog.com]().


### Billing

Billing is handled per Organization. Upgrading applies to a specific Organization and unlocks paid features for that Organization and its Backlogs.

All payments are processed through [Stripe](https://www.stripe.com); no other payment methods are supported.
